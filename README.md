# Advent of Code


[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) offers every year nice problems to practice your coding.
I take this as an excuse to learn of refresh my knowledge of a programming language:

- [2015: C](/2015): I did not really do it in 2015 (18 days completed)
- [2020: Python](/2020): Whohou I finished it
- [2021: Vimscript](/2021): (Yes really 17 days of vimscript)
- [2022: Rust](/2022): I went blazingly fast (or at least I tried) for 11 days
- [2023: Haskell](/2023): Side effect free since 23

## Notes

- The history of the commit was lost as I used to do it with my Research lab in another repository.
- Some absolute paths can be found here and there sorry about that...
